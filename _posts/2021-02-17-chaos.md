Chaos theory is the study of how deterministic systems are sensitive to initial conditions. Specifically, Edward Lorenz tried to understand why very tiny variations in the initial conditions of his convection weather simulations resulted in drastically different solutions. In his case, a number that was rounded too short gave a completely different result! Important to note here is that given the exact same initial conditions, a chaotic system is completely deterministic. But in reality, it is impossible to force the exact same initial conditions on a system, due to the fact that we can not measure to infinite decimal places.

So lets have a quick look at the equations that describe chaotic convection in 3d space:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma(y-x),$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = x(\rho - z) - y,$$

$$\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z.$$

Here each equation desribes how a particle would move in the x, y, and z directions respectively. We can see that each equation depends on the position of the previous timestep (with some added factors). Physically it doesn't really matter what the terms σ, ρ, and β mean but they are parameters that describe certain types of fluids (e.g. Rayleigh number), and are worth their own blog post!

So let's have a look at these equations coded up, I have selected (somewhat) random numbers for the fluid parameters (some values work better than others for our purposes).

Using Julia:
{% highlight julia %}
xdot = sigma*(y - x)
ydot = x*(rho - z) - y
zdot = x*y - beta*z
{% endhighlight %}

Here we calculate the change in each direction with respect to our timestep t. So let's define the attractor (it is called this for a reason I will explain below!), with 3 dimensions, in the vector named r. r gets modified by the derivatives calculated above.

{% highlight liquid %}
function make_attractor(nt, dt, x1, y1, z1)
    r = [zeros(nt), zeros(nt), zeros(nt)]
    r[1][1], r[2][1], r[3][1] = x1, y1, z1
    for i in 1:nt-1
        xdot, ydot, zdot = lorenz(r[1][i], r[2][i], r[3][i])
        r[1][i + 1] = r[1][i] + (xdot * dt)
        r[2][i + 1] = r[2][i] + (ydot * dt)
        r[3][i + 1] = r[3][i] + (zdot * dt)
    end
    r
end;
{% endhighlight %}
Now let us initialize an attractor

{% highlight liquid %}
dt = 0.01
nt = 10000
x1, y1, z1 = 1.0, 0.0, 0.0
r = make_attractor(nt, dt, x1, y1, z1)
{% endhighlight %}

And plot it:

Ok cool, looks great! So, what we have plotted out here is the path of a particle following our equations defined above, after a time $$dt \cdot t$$, by starting at our initial positions. If we were to change the initial conditions only slightly, we would see these paths would diverge. The global behaviour though looks similar. This in itself is very interesting, even though the individual paths are different, an ensemble of particles all behave similarly. The two points that the path seems to be attracted to is called the attractor. But what is an attractor?

To explain this we will look at another common equation that pops up in chaos theory, and that is the logistic map:

$$x_{n+1} = rx_n(1-x_n)$$

Here the equation is laid out in recursion form. It is commonly used in population modelling and it is a chaotic system. We can see this by looking at plots of $$x_{n+1}$$ vs $$x_n$$. This type of plot is called a Poincaré plot, after the mathetmatician and physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>, and is an extremely useful in examining chaotic systems. In the case of the logistic map, the value of r determines how chaotic the system is. For the logistic map to give meaningful results $$r \in [2.5,4.0]$$, where the higher values represent more chaotic systems. A value of $$r=3.0$$ results in the following logistic map:

![Logistic map 1](/assets/img/content/chaos/r3_poincareplot.gif "Logistic map for r=3")

We begin with a inital value, $$x_n = 0.1 $$, find the corresponding value of $$x_{n+1}$$ and then update the value of $$x_n$$ for the next iteration. This gives the behaviour of the grey line. We can see that for a value of $$r = 3.0 $$ this system converges towards a single value, somewhere around $$0.65$$. Changing this to $$r=3.5$$ we see the system now converges towards 4 attractors:

![Logistic map 2](/assets/img/content/chaos/r3p5_poincareplot.gif "Logistic map for r=3.5")

If we go as far as $$r=4.0$$, we see complete chaos, with no determinable attractor values:

What is great about the phase space we are looking at is that it can determine a chaotic system (one that has deterministic behaviour, but is very sensitive to initial conditions) from a random one. Let's say we have two time series, one generated using the logistic map, and another generated from random points:
