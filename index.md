    content: I can offer your firm extensive knowledge about data science because I had experience in developing various programs such as project microscopy image clustering, tweet sentiment classification, and machine learning. During my master, I was completely obsessed with up-to-date data science technologies such as deep learning techniques, so my thesis project is about image clustering using a generative model. Through the project, I realised that it is very important to deal with preprocessing data and feature engineering, and now that I have been dedicating my entire time to learning databases and backend programming. I can show you my ability in data science for contributing to your company growth.

# Kyungsu Choi

I am a <b>enjoyable and progmatic Data Scientist</b> inspired by though problems in real business.

## Let me introduce myself
I can offer your firm extensive knowledge about data science because I had experience in developing various programs such as project microscopy image clustering, tweet sentiment classification, and machine learning. During my master, I was completely obsessed with up-to-date data science technologies such as deep learning techniques, so my thesis project is about image clustering using a generative model. Through the project, I realised that it is very important to deal with preprocessing data and feature engineering, and now that I have been dedicating my entire time to learning databases and backend programming. I can show you my ability in data science for contributing to your company growth.
