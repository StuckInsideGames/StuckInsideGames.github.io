Hi! I am a postdoc working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Galway">University of Galway</a>. I am an astronomer by trade, converted to a general data scientist. I am currently working on earth observation (EO) solutions to climate change, in particular the resiliance of agri-food supply chains to the ever-increasing threat of climate breakdown. 

As an astronomer, my research interests include low-mass stars, stellar winds, coronal mass ejections, and exoplanets. I have recently completed an IRC postdoc on the study of electrostatic discharges on solar system planets (Saturn, Uranus). I have on-going radio observations of low-mass stars (interesting objects include $\lambda$ Andromedae and UV/BL Ceti!).
