Hi! I am an IRC postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUI_Galway">NUI Galway</a>. My research interests include low-mass stars, their winds, and exoplanets. I am currently working on detecting radio waves from these sources in space, and in particular planetary based electrostatic discharges.
