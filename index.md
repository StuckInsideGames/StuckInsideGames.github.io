  I am a professional problem solver of engineering with 4 years of experience looking for an opportunity to apply my skills in real-world business, and I'd love to bring my problem-solving skill and extensive knowledge to your growing development team.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see, I worked as an engineer and a project manager in an electrical part for 4 years. During this period I logically solved +400 engineering problems(projects) to meet various customers' requirements, so I could improve my problem-solving skill and learn how to logically think about problems. Although my problem skills were professional, I realised that most problems can be solved by data in engineering such as a smart factory. I also had a curiosity about data-based business Therefore, I recently put considerable effort into completing my master in MSc Data Analytics to be an expert.

  I can offer your firm extensive knowledge about data science because I had experience in developing various programs such as project microscopy image clustering, tweet sentiment classification, and machine learning. During my master, I was completely obsessed with up-to-date data science technologies such as deep learning techniques, so my thesis project is about image clustering using a generative model. Through the project, I realised that it is very important to deal with preprocessing data and feature engineering, and now that I have been dedicating my entire time to learning databases and backend programming. I can show you my ability in data science for contributing to your company growth.
