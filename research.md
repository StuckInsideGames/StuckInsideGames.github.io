      alt: wind
    description: A constantly varying stream of ionised plasma from the surface of the star out towards the interstellar medium makes a stellar wind. They affect how the host star evolves over its lifetime and impact any orbiting exoplanets. I use 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to quantify these winds and derive interesting parameters from them (e.g. mass-loss rate, spin-down rate, densities, temperatures, etc.). One significant question we can answer by researching these winds is "Are their exoplanets habitable?"
    #Stellar winds remove angular momentum from low-mass stars, effectively controlling how they spin-down and evolve. I use 3D MHD simulations to quantify these winds and derive interesting parameters from them. These winds also have significant impacts on orbiting exoplanets and affect the habitability of these objects.

      alt: lightning
    description: Planets in our solar system have exhibited lightning many times in the past (e.g. Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter). Lightning emits very strong radio signals, which could be detectable from Earth. I am using the worlds most sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes to try detect these transient events.

    description: The Sun emits many forms of radio emission, from different locations on its surface and in its atmosphere. That same radio emission could unlock the avenues to understanding the physical environment around other stars (winds, flares, ECMI, CME emissions) and their exoplanets (ECMI, planetary aurora, star-planet interactions).
