    description: Stellar winds remove angular momentum from low-mass stars, effectively controlling how they spin-down and evolve. I use 3D MHD simulations to quantify these winds, and derive interesting parameters from them. These winds also have significant impacts on orbiting exoplanets and affect the habitability of these objects.

   description: Following on from my stellar winds work, I became interested in the field of stellar radio emission. Stars emit many types of radio emission, with the dominant emission from hot stellar coronae. It is expected that radio emission will unlock the avenues to understanding the physical environment around these stars (quiescent wind, ECMI, auroral, transient CME emissions) and their exoplanets (ECMI, planetary aurora, star-planet interactions).

    description: Planets in our solar system have exhibited lightning many times in the past (e.g. Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter). Lightning emits very strong radio signals, which could be detectable from Earth. I am using the worlds most sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes to try detect these transient events.
